 We launched in 2019 with a ton of interest, and things have been going great since then:

- 📈 With 100m+ Docker pulls and a huge active user base/community - we have global traction
- ⭐️ With over ~70k~ 80k stars, we are now part of the top 150 projects on GitHub
- 🌱 We were Sequoia's first seed investment in Germany, and recently raised a $55m Series B round, led by Highland Capital

We're on a mission to give technical people the powers of a 10x developer. <a href="https://n8n.io/careers">Join us!</a>
