### Hi there, this is n8n 👋

n8n is the company behind n8n, the product. We're building a workflow automation platform that gives technical teams the flexibility of code with the speed of no-code. With 400+ integrations, native AI capabilities, and a [fair-code license](https://faircode.io), n8n lets you build powerful automation while maintaining full control over your data and deployments.

- Not interested in hosting n8n yourself? We also offer [n8n cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github.com&utm_campaign=readme) for a monthly fee. 
- Both our team and our users have been building a [workflow template library](https://n8n.io/workflows/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github.com&utm_campaign=readme) to help others easily get started with n8n automation.

 We launched in 2019 with a ton of interest, and things have been going great since then:

- 📈 With 100m+ Docker pulls and a huge active user base/community - we have global traction
- ⭐️ With over ~70k~ 80k stars, we are now part of the top 150 projects on GitHub
- 🌱 We were Sequoia's first seed investment in Germany, and recently raised a $55m Series B round, led by Highland Capital

We're on a mission to give technical people the powers of a 10x developer. [Join us!](https://n8n.io/careers)
